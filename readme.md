##CartoDB Template

This is a simple template based on [Chris Whong](http://chriswhong.com/)'s [excellent training](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ZQlgWfSDSbAdqO28ignBdqySECuUm9S6zL2yy-uvSs/edit?usp=sharing) on how to create basic interactive maps. I decided to put together this basic template for creating a simple interactive map that you can easily customize using the JavaScript variables included. [Click here](http://www.datapolitan.com/cartodb-tools/cartodb_template.html) for a live version of the map.

Enjoy and happy mapping.
